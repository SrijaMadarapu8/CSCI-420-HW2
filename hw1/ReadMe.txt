Description: In this assignment, we use Catmull-Rom splines along with OpenGL core profile shader-based texture mapping and Phong shading to create a roller coaster simulation.

Core Credit Features: (Answer these Questions with Y/N; you can also insert comments as appropriate)
======================

1. Uses OpenGL core profile, version 3.2 or higher - Y

2. Completed all Levels:
  Level 1 : - Y
  level 2 : - Y
  Level 3 : - Y
  Level 4 : - Y (the ground is replaced with a skybox but to show the result a mode is added were a texture is rendered onto the rail this can be seen by pressing 't' key)
  Level 5 : - Y

3. Rendered the camera at a reasonable speed in a continuous path/orientation - Y

4. Run at interactive frame rate (>15fps at 1280 x 720) - Y

5. Understandably written, well commented code - Y

6. Attached an Animation folder containing not more than 1000 screenshots - Y

7. Attached this ReadMe File - Y

Extra Credit Features: (Answer these Questions with Y/N; you can also insert comments as appropriate)
======================

1. Render a T-shaped rail cross section - N

2. Render a Double Rail - Y

3. Made the track circular and closed it with C1 continuity - N

4. Any Additional Scene Elements? (list them here) - added a tetrahedron to the render(renders when key h is pressed)

5. Render a sky-box - Y

6. Create tracks that mimic real world roller coaster - Y(added texture to the rail to mimic a real coaster)

7. Generate track from several sequences of splines - N

8. Draw splines using recursive subdivision - N

9. Render environment in a better manner - Y used skybox to make the render look better

10. Improved coaster normals - N

11. Modify velocity with which the camera moves - N

12. Derive the steps that lead to the physically realistic equation of updating u - N

Additional Features: (Please document any additional features you may have implemented other than the ones described above)
1. start and stop of the camera movement over the spline
2. rendering the track with a texture 
3. skybox with a sea view

Open-Ended Problems: (Please document approaches to any open-ended problems that you have tackled)
1. the direction the camer movement changes based on the  
2.
3. 

Keyboard/Mouse controls: (Please document Keyboard/Mouse controls if any)
1.1-for single rail
2.2-for double rail
3.m-to move the camera along the rail
4.s-to stop the movement of the camera
5.a-for animation and to save screenshots
6.h- to add obj to the scene
